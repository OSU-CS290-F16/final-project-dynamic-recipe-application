##### Description: 

The website would serve as the host for an application that takes in recipes from a cookbook (potentially even an online cookbook’s API) and allows the user to adjust the proportion of one ingredient while making proportional adjustments to all the other ingredients. For example if 1 stick of butter made 12 cookies and the user wanted to use 1/3rd a stick of butter, they could enter ‘1 stick’ and 12 serving sizes, then press the adjust button next to the butters entry field, press the submit button, and the website would replace the ‘12 serving sizes’ field with ‘4 serving sizes,’ so the user would know how many cookies 1/3rd a stick of butter could make.
